This password generator was supposed to have a pop up window to prompt the user:
number of characters, this was a text input stored in a global variable I named charCount -
prompt to confirm Uppercase, Lowercase, Special characters, and numbers these were a boolean true 
if else,,, statements-
I created a start function to run at button click, to run the Prompt function.
I wanted to attach the eventlistener to the button click at the begining to start the process 
for the prompt function, I asked the user input questions. then a generate password function
to call the values and finally a generaterandom function using Math.floor.random to generate random values from the inputs. 
I simply ran out of time. 
 I left all or most of my psuedo code in as this was my process to get an outline and work throuh the process.
